## why there is no WWDC21 AR animation ?

i didn't found any documentation on the WWDC21 AR easter egg, and the internet archive didn't archived any easter eggs (i saw on the markdown source)

## why in some events there are  "ios12" files

i don't know, i can only think it's for low end devices because they weight less and have not an animation or different color palettes.
