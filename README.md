## why there is no WWDC21 AR animation ?

i didn't found any documentation on the WWDC21 AR easter egg, and the internet archive didn't archived any easter eggs (i saw on the markdown source)

## why in some events there are  "ios12" or "ios14" files ?

i don't know, i can only think it's for low end devices because they weight less and have not an animation or different color palettes.
the ios 14 file is for the iPhone 14 Keynote, with the main named ios 15
